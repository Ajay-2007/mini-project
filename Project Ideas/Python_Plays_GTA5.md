## Python Plays GTA5

### Motivation : 
```text
In early days of Artificial Intelligence were crazy about solving and testing their Algorithms in Games like Puzzles, SAT problems, Chess and many more but his hasn't change since, even now people are focusing on solving hard problem (NP Hard) and simulate their Algorithms on a game like environments, this idea of testing Algorihtms and seeing the trade offs between different different Artificial Intelligence Algorithms has motivated us to build an AI Agent which can play the most beloved and yet the fully open world video game GTA5 in which agent will learn self driving, object detection, objective completion and Goal based objective and even some exploration of the open world.
Isn't it amazing to see that what people learn from trial and error can also be simulated in the real but game like environment which from game developer perspective has real world experience. As people learn to play games, they tend to learn from their mistakes Out idea is more the less same, We want to perform an <b>Evolutionary Algorithms a.k.a Genetic Algorithm</b> in our 
AI Agent which will learn to do all those things which takes a normal
people to learn a month or even a year.
In a nutshell we want to demonstrate an fully functional AI agent which can play GTA5 like games better than human using some of the most popular yet ever changing Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Techniques of Problem Solving. 

Benifit
	-> The Well Documented Algorithms and use cases can be use as Tutorial.
	-> Algorithmic Approach to Problem Solving
	-> One Algorithm can be use in any other game resulting in more performant way. As more the training with more data the more experienced algorithm gets.
