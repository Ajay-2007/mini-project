# Question Prediction<br>
![IIT Question Icon](https://github.com/Ajay-2007/mini-project/blob/master/Project%20Ideas/images/question_prediction.jpg)

<b>Problem Definition</b></br>
    <b>Motivation</b>
        - <p>When we were JEE Aspirants, we used to buy a book on the past 10-year question paper, practice paper, etc. What we have seen so far is that they all contain the questions from the last 10 years
        or even last 15 years.</p>
    <p>What if we can make a machine do this task for us so that we can have a question paper with full of the question with the greatest probability of coming up in the exam
        or a set of question paper from which the question with same or mixed up concepts will come up in the exam.
        </p>  
        <p>The motivation for us is to build an automated system which can perform this prediction accurately.
        To predict the pattern in a set of questions which may come in the next exam and so on.
        <br>
        And when the institute is going to set a question paper for Test round they can 
        use our software to generate a bunch of question with the highest probability rate of coming into the exam
        in this way the student can benefit from the question and likely to ACE the final exam.


    Benefits
        -> Time reduction in problem setting
        -> greater probability of coming off the same question in Future
        -> Productivity of Teacher increases.

    Idea
        - We are going to select a bunch of features from the question like
            - From which subject the problem is from e.g. Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.
            - From which topic does the problem came from e.g. Trigonometry, SHM, Organic Chemistry, etc.
            - In which category does the problem belong to.
            - Including three categories for the problem e.g. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced.
            - In this way, the problems can have many features which will lead to a good prediction 
              and the likelihood of coming in the exam or from the same concept.

        - Depending on the dataset we will choose and apply our Machine Learning Algorithms on the
        dataset using Clustering Algorithm and some optimization techniques.

        - After this a Graph Visualization showing the which year does the question came and what are the chances of coming to the same question or question from the same concept again.
