## Unique Question identifier.


Problem Definition
```text
Given a set of questions on a particular subject we are going to identify those questions having same meaning and 
then we will clup them into a single question so that finally a dataset of unique questions can be created.
  
Usage- Often coaching centres have huge dataset of questions in which multiple questions are written using different
terminologies but have same meanin. when they need to set-up a question paper for students, they run a random function
to generate a question paper of suppose "N" questions. but there is a high possibility that they have same questions so 
they need to check this up manually. from our software, this problem can be resolved completely.
